When the Greeks had been in Troy, Epeus constructed the massive wooden horse. Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon,
Neoptolemus were all gathered in the horse. And in the horse they wrote “The Greeks gave a gift to Minervae”, they moved the military 
camp to tenedo. When the Trojans saw it, Priam led the horse of Minervae in the temple. Although Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, 
faith was not given to her and they placed the horse in front of the temple. The Greeks exited and killed the guards and Troy was conquered.
