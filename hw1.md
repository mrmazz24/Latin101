A regular Latin verb has four principle parts. 

The first and third are finite verb forms, and are both first person singular.

The third principal part of faciō, “Fēcī”, is identical to the third principal part of interfaciō, interfēcī. The first and second change the “a” in “faciō” to an i, making it interficiō and intericĕre. The fourth changes the same “a” to an e, so it is interfectus.

Veniō and audiō are fourth conjugation verbs, and their principal parts are regular. Their fourth parts can be predicted by keeping the root from the first three parts, and adding "-tus".  ❓ *Can you predict their 4th parts from the other three?*

The verbs capiō and faciō have the same changes to their principal parts, keeping the root “cap” and “fac”. They both have an exception for the third part, where the "a" in the root switches to an "e", making cep- and fec-  ❓ *What about their 3rd part?*
